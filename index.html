			<h1>The less you know the better</h1>
			<h2>u are the music in me la la la la</h2>
			<p>Someone said they left together, I ran out the door to get her, she was holding hands with Trevor, not the greatest feeling ever... Said, "Pull yourself together,
			you should try your luck with Heather".
			Then I heard they slept together...
			Oh, the less I know the better...
			The less I know the better!</p>

			<h2> Eventually </h2>
			<p> All I know about the genesis of that song is that I was on the back of a scooter. I think I was in Perth and my friend was driving the scooter and I was on the back. I don’t know why, but I started singing it in my head. The song is about knowing that you’re about to damage someone almost irreparably, and the only consolation you get is this distant hope that they’ll be alright eventually, because you know that they aren’t going to be now or soon. It’s like... Fuck! That’s all I remember. I was on the back of the scooter and the wind was rushing through me. </p>
